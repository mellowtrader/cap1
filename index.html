        <h1>Best New Socks - Website Plan</h1>
        <hr/>
        <img src="./assets/images/socks.jpg">
        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>The goal is to create a website with the best user experience
            that guides customers to the perfect pair of socks for them.
        </p>
        <p> There will be no need for searching, wondering about size or fit,
            or selecting anything beyond design.
        </p>
        <p>This will be accomplished with a clean layout that poses a series
            of questions to the customer, with the answers narrowing the
            products that fit their specifications.
        </p>

        <h2>Sock Connoisseur</h2>
        <p>I've been wearing socks for over 40 years. I've worn ankle socks,
            knee socks, and everything in between. Some have been too thin.
            Some have been to thick and stuffy. Some have not held up, and
            some have cut off circulation. 
        </p>
        <p>Few have been perfect. The perfect socks I have found have been
            a blessing.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <h2>Needs List</h2>
        <p>Once created, the website will need... 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a <a href="./assets/suppliers.html">supplier</a> of quality socks of
                all types.  More than one supplier may need to be used. Need to 
                research sock suppliers.</li>
            <li>a checkout counter. I'll need a <a href="./assets/hosts.html">website
            host</a> that works well with Shopify.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr/>
        <h2>Organizational and Legal for Later</h2>
        <p>Tax and legal requirements to establish an LLC will be required.
            I'll need a dedicated email with the webhost, so as to have the
            same domain name. 
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Once all that is accomplished, it'll be time to market and advertise!</h3>
